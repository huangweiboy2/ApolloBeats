# ApolloBeats!

**ApolloBeats** is a simple discord bot written in **C# .NET Core**. The bot can execute simple commands and play music by using **Victoria**. This is just an example of how you can build your own Discord Bot so feel free to clone my project, test it, edit it how you want. Feel free to share and don't forget to give me a star! :D


## Before setup

Before you get going, you will need these things:
> Updated project is located on **Development** branch.
> Latest java runtime version. It can be found on their website.
> Music player: **Library**([Victoria]([https://github.com/Yucked/Victoria](https://github.com/Yucked/Victoria))) |  **Documentation**([Victoria wiki]([https://github.com/Yucked/Victoria/wiki](https://github.com/Yucked/Victoria/wiki)))
> Discord .NET: **Library**([Discord .NET]([https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net)))

## Setup

1. Clone the project and try to understand how it works.
2. To set your **bot token** and **bot prefix**, go to `Config.json` and set it there.
- Ensure you are providing a valid **bot token** otherwise it won't work!
3. Open a new shell window (**cmd** | **powershell** | **GIT bash**) where your your **Lavalink** is located and execute this command: `java -jar Lavalink.jar`
4. Start the bot in debug mode and wait until it connects to **Discord**.
5. Feel free to edit anything and enjoy!
